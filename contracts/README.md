# MeridianKeel

Keel's Hold tier (v1.1, spec section 6): a user-funded daily spend-cap vault for native MON on Monad. This is the security-critical piece of Meridian — the only part of the product that ever holds user funds.

> **Status: first draft, not yet audited.** This has a full test suite and passes it, but that is not the same thing as an audit. Per the spec's own build-in-public plan, this contract goes through a public self-audit — spec thread → invariant tests thread → self-audit findings thread — published alongside deployment. **Deployed to Monad testnet only for now** (see "Deploying" below); mainnet deployment is on the roadmap and waits for the self-audit to actually happen, not for a deadline to force it.

## Design

One policy type, deliberately minimal scope:

- Users deposit native MON into their own vault position.
- Spends within the wallet's configured daily cap execute instantly.
- Spends over cap are queued with a 24-hour timelock, cancelable by the user at any time before execution.
- Increasing the daily cap (including setting it for the first time — going from 0 is also an increase) is timelocked 24 hours. Decreasing is instant. The timelock on increases is the actual product: a forced pause against impulsive or coerced decisions, not just a defense against attackers.
- Emergency withdrawal of the full available balance is always available but delayed 12 hours. The request emits an event Meridian's off-chain layer watches to send an email alert — the delay plus visibility is the drainer-resistance mechanism.
- The daily window is a reset-on-next-spend-after-24h model, not a continuously rolling window — a deliberate simplification, documented in the contract, that's cheap to reason about at the cost of slight imprecision at the boundary.
- The owner has no path to user funds. Owner powers are limited to pausing new deposits and updating a published allowlist pointer (informational metadata only — never enforced on-chain).

Out of scope for this version, by design: ERC-20 support (MON only; USDC is a stated follow-up in the spec), on-chain destination allowlisting, and true continuous rolling windows.

## Usage

```bash
forge build
forge test
forge test -vvv              # with call traces
forge coverage --report summary
forge fmt                    # or --check in CI
```

Requires `lib/forge-std`, vendored directly in this repo (not a git submodule — see `.gitignore`).

## Deploying (Monad testnet)

```bash
cp .env.example .env   # fill in MONAD_TESTNET_RPC_URL, ETHERSCAN_API_KEY

# One-time: import the deployer key into an encrypted local keystore.
# Prompts for the private key and a keystore password — neither touches
# disk in plaintext, unlike a PRIVATE_KEY env var.
cast wallet import meridian-deployer --interactive

forge script script/DeployMeridianKeel.s.sol \
  --rpc-url monad_testnet \
  --broadcast \
  --account meridian-deployer \
  --verify
```

`--account` prompts for the keystore password at broadcast time (or set `ETH_PASSWORD`/`--password-file` for non-interactive runs). The broadcasting key becomes the contract's `owner` — see `DeployMeridianKeel.s.sol` for why that's a low-stakes role (no fund custody) and how to hand it off with `cast send <address> "transferOwnership(address)" <newOwner> --rpc-url monad_testnet --account meridian-deployer` afterward if needed.

`--verify` submits source to Etherscan's V2 multichain API (serves testnet.monadexplorer.com) using the `monad_testnet` entry in `foundry.toml`'s `[etherscan]` block; omit it and run `forge verify-contract <address> src/MeridianKeel.sol:MeridianKeel --chain monad_testnet` separately if you'd rather verify after confirming the deployment looks right on-chain first.

Broadcast receipts under `broadcast/*/10143/` are committed as a deployment record; local anvil dry runs (`broadcast/*/31337/`) are gitignored.

**Mainnet deployment is intentionally not happening yet.** The four-gate self-audit plan (spec → invariant tests → self-audit findings → public review) has to actually run against this contract before real user funds should be trusted to it — testnet is where that happens without that risk. To deploy mainnet once the audit is done, use the `monad` rpc/etherscan entries (already configured in `foundry.toml`) in place of `monad_testnet` above.

## Test suite

44 deterministic tests in `test/MeridianKeel.t.sol`, plus a fuzzed invariant suite in `test/MeridianKeel.invariant.t.sol`.

Deterministic coverage:

- Every state transition (deposit, cap change, spend, cancel, emergency withdrawal) on both its success and failure paths
- **Every distinct `require()` revert message in the contract has at least one dedicated test** — verified by direct cross-reference against the source, not just by trusting `forge coverage`'s branch numbers (which turned out to be an unreliable way to detect gaps here — a genuinely-tested revert path showed as 0 hits due to how the tool's branch/path numbering works with the optimizer disabled for coverage runs; treat the tool's summary as a starting point; confirming gaps by reading the contract is what actually caught the real ones)
- Reentrancy: a `noReentrancy` guard shared across all fund-moving functions, exercised by an attacker contract that tries to re-enter both the same function and a *different* guarded function from within a callback
- Fund conservation: the contract's own ETH balance always equals the sum of tracked vault balances plus every still-unresolved queued spend's reserved amount — including while a spend is actually in flight, not just before/after
- Transfer-failure paths (a recipient that rejects plain ETH transfers) roll back cleanly with state unchanged, for all three functions that move funds out

Invariant/fuzz coverage (`test/handlers/MeridianKeelHandler.sol` drives every state-changing function across 4 actors with randomized time warps, 512 runs × 500 calls = 256,000 calls per `forge test`):

- **`invariant_fundConservation`** — the contract's ETH balance must equal tracked vault balances plus reserved pending-spend amounts after *any* sequence the fuzzer finds, not just the scenarios a human wrote down. Passes clean at 256,000 calls.
- The first version of this suite also asserted `spentInWindow <= dailyCap` always — the fuzzer broke that in a handful of calls (decrease your cap below what you've already spent this window, and `spentInWindow` legitimately exceeds the new `dailyCap`). Traced by hand: not exploitable, it only forces the rest of that window's spends onto the timelocked path, never loosens anything. Real finding, wrong invariant — removed the incorrect assertion, documented the actual behavior in `setDailyCap`'s NatSpec, and pinned it down with `test_setDailyCap_decreaseBelowSpentInWindow_forcesQueuedPathForRestOfWindow`. Left in this README because it's a good example of what fuzzing is actually for: it found something a careful read-through hadn't surfaced, and it was cheaper to catch here than after real funds were involved.

Result: 100% line, statement, branch, and function coverage on `src/MeridianKeel.sol` (`test/helpers/` and `test/handlers/` coverage is lower and expected to be — those are test doubles, not production code).

**What this test suite still does not cover, and what a real audit should add:** gas griefing analysis on the reentrancy guard, and formal reasoning about the window-reset simplification's edge cases under adversarial timing.
